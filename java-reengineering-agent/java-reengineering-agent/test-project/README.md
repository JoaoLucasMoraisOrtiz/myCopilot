# test-project - Java Reengineering Project

This workspace was initialized by the Java Reengineering Agent.

## Structure

- `legacy-system/` - Place your legacy Java code here
- `new-system/` - Generated modern code will be placed here
- `analysis-results/` - Analysis reports and findings
- `feature-backlog/` - Generated feature decomposition
- `logs/` - Agent execution logs
- `output/` - Additional generated artifacts

## Quick Start

1. Copy your legacy Java code to `legacy-system/`
2. Run analysis: `java-reengineering-agent analyze`
3. Review results in `analysis-results/`
4. Generate new system: `java-reengineering-agent generate`

## Configuration

Edit `agent.toml` to customize the reengineering process.
